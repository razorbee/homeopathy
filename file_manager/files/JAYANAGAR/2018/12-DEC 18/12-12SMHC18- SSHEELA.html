Always compares with others want to be better than me. Confidence is dependent on your beauty. Stopped believing in God. Use to b dependent on God but last 2 years im not in a state whr I depend on God fr anything. Its depndent on me and not others. Specially when the elder sis baby was born with a defect she lost all of the faith. Mayb i feel so after marriage I cant express things ot my family n I learnt to solve things by myself and I have to depend only on myself. Im independent. Someone said tht she was pregnant bcoz she got tummy. She felt conscious of her body. Don’t want kids coz of finances and a baby in her family elder sis baby is affected with the disease so she is scared tht her kid wil get it too. M not good at it (sex). My husband expects a lot frm it and she says m adamant. I dnt take first step but if people come to me im friendly.</p>
